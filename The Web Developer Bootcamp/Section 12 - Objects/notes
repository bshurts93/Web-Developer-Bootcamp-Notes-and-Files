OBJECTS

- Objects' contents have no given order, just floating key value pairs
- Retrieving data:
    console.log(person["name"]); ---> bracket notation
    console.log(person.name); ---> dot notation
    
    * cannot use dot notation if the property starts with a number
    * cannot use dot notation if the property is a string with spaces
    * you can lookup a var name using bracket notation

- Objects can hold all sorts of data: strings, booleans, numbers, arrays and even other objects


ARRAYS vs OBJECTS

- Arrays are bound to index numbers, objects (and their key value pairs) have no order
-
