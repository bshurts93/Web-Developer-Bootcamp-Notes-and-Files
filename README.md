# Web-Developer-Bootcamp-Notes-and-Files
A collection of the notes, code-alongs and experiments I've coded with Colt Steele's Udemy Bootcamp course, "The Web Developer Bootcamp".

This is the second comprehensive bootcamp course I've taken through Udemy, the first being Jonas Schmedtmann's "The Complete JavaScript Course 2018: Build Real Projects!"

95% of the course so far has been review of all the concepts I have learned from previous learning, but I am enjoying the deepened comprehension of going through from the beginning again.
